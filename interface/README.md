# Mapping Process platform interface

## About Interface

This application is responsible for demonstrating the user interface in a practical and effective way, so that the user feels at ease and without the need for a great knowledge of technology.

# Technologies used
## Fron-end
- ReactJS (Framework)
- TypeScript (Language)
- Tailwind (Framework CSS)



## Why ReactJS ?

I chose React.js to implement the front end because it offers efficiency, performance, component reuse, active community, and flexibility for integration with other technologies. These aspects make React.js a solid choice for creating modern and interactive user interfaces.
